Over the past eight years, I’ve worked in Customer Operations and Technical Support, gaining a deep understanding of the software industry. Through this experience, I’ve developed a strong interest in defensive security, networking, and systems management—fields that keep me engaged and constantly learning.

This blog is a space to share my journey, from scripting and automation projects to threat intelligence and network analysis. It’s a collection of ideas, experiments, and challenges that drive me to grow and sharpen my skills.
