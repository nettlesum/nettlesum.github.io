**Nettlesome** [ net-l-suhm ]  
*adjective*
1. causing irritation, vexation, or annoyance:  
*to cope with a nettlesome situation.*\\
  
If a problem is nettlesome, I cannot help but enjoy finding a solution to it. I've worked with computers and in the software industry for all of my professional life in support, operations and product roles. This blog serves as a home for my growing interest in security, particularly as a means of publishing my attempts to learn malware analysis, detection and rule writing and other seemingly disparit and unrelated topics.
