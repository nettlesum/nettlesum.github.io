If a problem is nettlesome, I cannot help but enjoy finding a solution to it. 

I have worked with computers and in various roles in customer support, operations and product throughout my professional career. This blog serves as a home for my growing interest in security, particularly as a means of publishing my attempts to learn malware analysis, detection and rule writing and other seemingly disparit and unrelated topics.

You can find me on Twitter as [@nettlesum](https://twitter.com/nettlesum).
