I (as much as there is an "I" to begin with) am a technologist currently working for a software company. In my spare time I am occupied by my interest in malware research and threat intelligence. 

This blog serves as a node to host writing and learnings on security research and the philosophies and ideas that surround it.

You can find me on Twitter [@nettlesum](https://twitter.com/nettlesum).
