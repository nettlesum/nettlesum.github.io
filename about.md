I’ve spent the past eight years working in Customer Operations and Technical Support roles, getting to know the ins and outs of the software industry. Along the way, I’ve discovered a real passion for defensive security, networking, and systems management: fields that keep me curious and always learning.

This blog is where I share what I’m working on, from scripting and task automation to network analysis. It’s a mix of ideas, projects, and the occasional challenge that pushes me to grow.
