I work in the software industry with experience in customer support, operations, and product development. In my spare time, my interest in threat analysis leads me to explore the cybersecurity space. 

Being able to solve complex problems through in-depth study and research brings me immense satisfaction, a feeling that Iâ€™ve come to find often when analysing network traffic or digging through malware samples.

My current interests are in malware traffic analysis, threat detection (rule writing) and threat intelligence more broadly. 

Ultimately, I want to find a role in the cybersecurity space and become adept at detecting, analysing and mitigating threats. On this blog I'll share my learning process, write-ups and cheat sheets, as well as ramblings on other seemingly disparate and unrelated topics.

You can find me on Twitter as [@nettlesum](https://twitter.com/nettlesum).
