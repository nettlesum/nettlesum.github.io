***Time moves in one direction, memory in another.***

I am a long-time technologist currently working for a software company, with an interest to expand and grow my knowledge in the areas of networking and security: specifically malware analysis and threat intelligence. Additionally, I hope to learn more about programming at both a low and high level.

This site serves as a place for me to post about the different topics and exercises that I work on and learn about, so that I can reference them in the future, or that they might be useful to someone else in a similar position as I. 

You can find me on Twitter via [@nettlesum](https://twitter.com/nettlesum).
