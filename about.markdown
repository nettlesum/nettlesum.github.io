***Time moves in one direction, memory in another.***

This site will house content that may often feel orderless. Generally, it will relate to networking, security, systems internals and occasionally things as disparit and foreign as fiction, poetry and musical and political theory.

More than anything, it will simply serve as a means of archiving the things that I (as much as there is an "I" to begin with) learn and enjoy so that they can be referenced as time passes.
